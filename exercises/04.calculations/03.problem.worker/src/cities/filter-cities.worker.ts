// 🐨 you're gonna need this:
// import * as Comlink from 'comlink'
// 🐨 move the stuff that's in index.ts into this file.

// 🐨 create an object called "exposed" that has searchCities in it
// 🐨 call Comlink.expose with the exposed object
// 🐨 create and export a type called "Exposed" that is "typeof exposed"
//   (you'll need this to get nice type safety in the main thread)
